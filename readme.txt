HOW DO I MAKE IT HAPPEN?

Under WooCommerce, you will get a option for After Order Discounts.
You will find two options here. One to create a discount and other for Settings. Fortune Wheel settings and coupon settings could be set up here. You can assign the page, where you would like to show your fortune wheel. You can also define if this wheel should be shown only to logged in user.

This plugin is divided into three parts. General, conditions and Discount.

**General:** This is where you create a discount. You can give it a discount name, start date, end date along with the rule description. You can also deactivate the discount when you think it is not required anymore.

**Conditions:** The condition could be defined based on “And/or” on different parameters. Every parameter would have different conditions on which the coupons could filter to be provided only to the privileged customers. Similarly, each condition could be defined based on different condition and parameters.

**Discount:** In this tab, it could be defined how the coupon would be redeemed. Either a flat discount of an amount could be provided or a percentage could be provided.

**EXAMPLE: Condition Based**

Discount could be provided based on “And” and “Or” condition. For Example, if you want to provide a discount for the customers whose order total is 1000 AND payment method is PayPal.

**Order Total**
The coupon code will be provided only to those customers whose order total will match on the added condition.

**Order Item**
Coupon Code will not be provided until the customer will purchase added items. You can either specify the products which in the list or not in the list.

**Order Categories**
Just like Order Item, the coupon code will not be provided until items from added category are not purchased. Category can be chosen which is in the list or not in the list.

**Order Customers**
This condition could be specified only if you want the coupon to be generated for specific customers or their category. Customers could be chosen who are on the list or not on the list.

**Payment Methods**
 Coupon will be provided only to specified customers for specific payment method.
